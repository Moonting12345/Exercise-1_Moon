<h2>How we got there</h2>

  <p>Cornerstone started with a simple (but bold) idea – to improve access to
    education on a global basis through online learning. We were a tiny company
    back in 1999, with a different name, a single shared cordless phone, and a
    jarringly bright orange logo. But the seed was planted: we were off and
    running with the belief that ongoing learning and development are at the
    heart of how to be both a better individual and a better organization.
    In the past twenty years, Cornerstone has come a long way. We’ve got more
    than one phone now, for instance. But our heritage of focusing on the
    importance of learning has remained a constant. The Cornerstone Unified
    Talent Management suite addresses critical talent needs. It helps businesses
     find and attract the right people for the right roles and then makes sure
     they are onboarded in the most efficient and effective way possible. It
     helps organizations keep a better pulse on employee performance and ensure
      readiness for new roles. It helps to connect employees and locate expertise
       so that people can do their jobs better in any given moment.</p>
